# External-R6S
TBH, everything in here was from unknowncheats

It has a IMGUI overlay, but it's not really there for anything as i'm a lazy bastard but 
you can mess around with. Most of the code was from a nice little fella named Paging.

The base was from: https://github.com/VHMCODERhoff/Source-R6-Modified/blob/master/usermode%20modified/main.cpp
ImGui Overlay: https://github.com/furkankadirguzeloglu/ImGuiExternal


Features:
- Outlines
- No Sky
- No spread
- Map Colour Changer
